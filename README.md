WhoPaid
=======

A small SMS based app built for me and my housemates
to keep track of relevant house payments.
Notifies housemates each time a new payment is submitted,
and keeps track of who owes who. Allowes for direct
payments between housemates, along with housewide
payments.

The project gave me a nice chance to work with some new
technologies, in particular my first experience (albeit
at a small scale) with a NoSQL db.

Technologies
------------
* Python (on Flask)
